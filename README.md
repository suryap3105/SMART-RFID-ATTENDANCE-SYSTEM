# 🛡️ Smart Attendance System using RFID + Fingerprint + Ultrasonic

A complete end-to-end attendance system that combines RFID cards, fingerprint scanning, and ultrasonic presence detection. The system logs access events locally and visually using a real-time Streamlit dashboard, storing all data in a CSV file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ RFID Authentication (via MFRC522)
- ✅ Fingerprint Matching (via R307 module)
- ✅ Ultrasonic Sensing (system powers ON only when user is within 25 cm)
- ✅ EEPROM Storage of enrolled UID ↔ Fingerprint pairs
- ✅ Serial Logging:
  - UID
  - Fingerprint ID
  - Distance from ultrasonic
  - Access status (Granted/Denied)
- ✅ Streamlit Dashboard:
  - Live ultrasonic feed
  - Access event log
  - Downloadable CSV
- ✅ Menu-driven Serial Interface:
  - `E` → Enroll (pair UID + Finger ID)
  - `L` → Login
  - `I` → List all users
  - `D` → Delete a user (by Fingerprint ID)
  - `R` → Reset (with EEPROM dump and confirmation)

## 🧠 How It Works

### 👣 Login Flow:

1. Ultrasonic sensor detects user presence **within 25 cm**
2. RFID card is scanned
3. Fingerprint is scanned
4. If the UID ↔ Fingerprint ID match → ✅ Access Granted
5. Otherwise → ❌ Access Denied

All events are logged to Serial and CSV.

## 🧰 Hardware Required

| Component             | Description                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno/Nano     | Main controller                 |
| MFRC522              | RFID card reader (SPI)          |
| R307                 | Fingerprint sensor (UART)       |
| HC-SR04              | Ultrasonic sensor               |
| LEDs/Buzzer (Optional) | For access status feedback    |

## 🔌 Wiring Overview

| Module       | Arduino Pins            |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| MFRC522      | SDA → D10, SCK → D13, MOSI → D11, MISO → D12, RST → D9 |
| R307         | TX → D2, RX → D3 (SoftwareSerial) |
| Ultrasonic   | Trig → D7, Echo → D6     |

Make sure to power R307 via 5V external supply if needed.

## 🧑‍💻 Setup & Run

### 1️⃣ Flash Arduino Code

- Upload `rfid_fingerprint_attendance.ino` to your Arduino board
- Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud
- Use menu commands like `E`, `L`, `I`, `D`, `R`

### 2️⃣ Run Python Streamlit Dashboard

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas pyserial
```

Start the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧪 Sample Output

### 📟 Serial Monitor:
```
[Ultrasonic] Distance = 21 cm
⚡ System powered ON by user presence.
📇 RFID UID: D1:81:C0:01
🔐 Fingerprint ID: 5
✅ Access Granted

LOG,D1:81:C0:01,5,21,Access Granted
```

### 📄 CSV Log:
```
Timestamp,UID,Fingerprint ID,Distance (cm),Access
2025-04-16 18:05:22,D1:81:C0:01,5,21,Access Granted
```

## 🛠 Reset & Safety

- `R` command prints EEPROM dump and asks for confirmation
- Type `'Y'` to proceed — this clears EEPROM and fingerprint DB

---

## 📈 Future Add-ons

- SD card backup logging
- Wi-Fi or GSM cloud sync
- OLED display UI
- Mobile notification via Twilio or Telegram
- Admin override mode
